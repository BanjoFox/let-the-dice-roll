			<title><![CDATA[EP21 - This is a Dark Place]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>WARNING: This game contains mature themes!</strong></p>
<p>In typical late fashion, we kick off a "Spoopy" series of episodes that focus on more horror-themed games. &nbsp;This one is all about "In Dark Alleys". &nbsp;A game of modern horror by independent publisher Vajra Enterprises. &nbsp;This game has loads of interesting character options, dark plots that put black holes to shame, and a system (Organic Rule Components), which can add hyper realism to any campaign.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes games run too long, players get bored of the same old thing, and you need a change of pace. &nbsp;That was the plan anyways. &nbsp;But as usual with this podcast, Banjo takes the opportunity to check in with Raspathir (self-care reminder!). &nbsp;That leads to YET ANOTHER cathartic rant, but fortunately the boys are able to use that energy in the second half to get back on topic. &nbsp;A palate cleanser for the hosts, as well as actual advice for gaming.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[EP14 - Session Zero]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Session Zero is a very important aspect of every roleplaying game. Whether it be for a one-shot, or a multi-year campaign. It is a time where the game host, and players can get to know one another, what they want to play, and even get a bit of a preview for what is to come. While it may not always be necessary, it can certainly clear up a whole bunch of questions.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Not one to leave folks hanging, Banjo has done gone off script and recorded an entire episode BY HIMSELF and uncut!!! &nbsp;Oh the horror, such woe, et. al!!! &nbsp;We are not at all kidding either... Banjo sits down, with a glass of adult beverage, and just talks into the microphone. &nbsp;There is a bit of behind-the-scenes stuff, motivations for the podcast, and a whole lot of him ranting. &nbsp;Will this keep him from ranting endlessly in other episdoes? &nbsp;Possibly.. fingers crossed!</p>
<p>Both boys will be back for Season 2 in a little while (next week hopefully!). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This episode has been marked "explicit" for some foul language, but really it's just a couple of naughty words that would probably make it a T for Teen rating (the usual). &nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Following close on the heels of the Worst Episode Ever is the unexpected Season Finale!<br>
Unexpected because we had planned at least another episode but time, and other factors came up. &nbsp;Blah blah blah.</p>
<p>In THIS episode we have a mix of topics, a -very- unscripted grab bag if you will.<br>
We are dark next week, but after that we are going to come back with Season 2!<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>
Has this ever happened to you? The party is moving along nicely, everyone knows their part in the plan, then SUDDENLY, everything is on FIRE. Well, we have the solution for you!
Actually.... no. That is a lie. But! We DO talk about how things can go badly, and offer a few small words about how to handle those situations.

Additionally: As Banjo says in the cold open, Ratkin are organized by "Aspects" and not "Plagues". Le sigh..

			<title><![CDATA[EP10 - The Trouble with Godliness]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>
What started out as a nice conversation about Scion: Hero, a game in which players get to create direct offspring of their favorite gods, turned into a rather anxiety-inducing origin story about a recurring antagonist which Banjo, and his fellow players love to hate. Mind you there is a bit of ... mild language so this episode has been marked explicit accordingly.

			<title><![CDATA[EP07 - Dice, Love, Gaming]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week Banjo goes on one heck of a rant about his gaming addiction, and tries to warn others against the danger. Thankfully, Raspathir is able to provide a glimmer of hope that newer gamers won't end up in the same trap. &nbsp;There is also a LOT of chat about dice; collecting, laying down rules, and even how to "teach" them what not to do. &nbsp;</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;This week Banjo goes on one heck of a rant about his gaming addiction, and tries to warn others against the danger. Thankfully, Raspathir is able to provide a glimmer of hope that newer gamers won&apos;t end up in the same trap. &amp;nbsp;There is also a LOT of chat about dice; collecting, laying down rules, and even how to &quot;teach&quot; them what not to do. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
