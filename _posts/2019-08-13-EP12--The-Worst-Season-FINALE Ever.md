<p>Following close on the heels of the Worst Episode Ever is the unexpected Season Finale!<br />
Unexpected because we had planned at least another episode but time, and other factors came up.  Blah blah blah.<br />

In THIS episode we have a mix of topics, a -very- unscripted grab bag if you will.<br />
We are dark next week, but after that we are going to come back with Season 2!</p>
