## Will there be a part 2?

<br />


Taking a break from ranting, Banjo lets Raspathir have a turn at the microphone with tales about a D&D game he is currently part of.  His character, Syalas the Open-Palm monk, joins up with a party of adventurers that have already had a few encounters of their own.  Together they go forth, but find trouble along the path to their next destination.  Unable to help himself, Banjo does have a SHORT rant about the lack of dragons in the game, thus birthing the term "introductory dragons".  To be continued...?
