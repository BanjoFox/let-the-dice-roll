## Mozilla Global Sprint 2018 
I have submitted the Aardwolf project to Mozilla's Global Sprint (May 10th-11th), and have been (somewhat) frantically trying to get the repository ready.
If you would like to check out what other projects are part of go check them out! [Mozilla Global Sprint Homepage](https://foundation.mozilla.org/opportunity/global-sprint/).
By "getting the repository ready" I mean mostly working on documentation, and trying to better define what in the heck it is we need!
<br />
<br />
### Hackers Guide to Aardwolf
Most of the above has been coming in the form of ***The Hackers Guide to Aardwolf***.  The hackers guide, is simply a top-level directory which I am using as a library for documenting the development targets/features.
At this point pretty much all of the docs in here (including the README.md) are first-draft attempts, and likely need a lot of collaboration to really flesh out the ideas.  But hey!  It is a starting point right?
I should also note that, while there are a few docs in here already, I've started a new branch (note_taking) which is currently tracking the chaotic mess of me adding things on the fly.  Hoping to merge this soon.

### Public demo, closing user registrations
The, seemingly, steady flow of user-auth requests for the live demo have been enough to make me want to put a hiatus on them.  For the time being I've frozen the new user creations because there really-and-truly is not much
more than a static web page that allow authentication.  When we have something more interesitng to look at, the registrations will open again.  If however, you are a developer that would like to do testing, please let me know, and we can work something out :)

### New repository for Aardwolf Interface hackers
I have created a separate repository that can be used by folks that would prefer to only work on what the future of Aardwolf looks/feels like.
That is found here: [Aardwolf Interface Development](https://github.com/BanjoFox/aardwolf-interface)
