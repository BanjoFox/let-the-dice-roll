Banjo and Raspathir finally get around to explaining what Ananasi are, including Banjo's first in character encounter with one.  Banjo also shares what it was like to be ghouled by a vampire.  Finally they wrap up with some tidbits about the other things that creep around in the World of Darkness.  Warning: This episode may contain spiders.  Lots, and lots, and lots of spiders.
