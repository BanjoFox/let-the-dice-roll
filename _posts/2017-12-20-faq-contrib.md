## Hello! 
Welcome to the Aardwolf project!

Not really sure where I should start off but maybe if I just keep typing something cool will come to me... OH, I know! 

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why not contribute to Diaspora, Friendica, or [insert_project here]?**

A few reasons. 
- One, at the time of inception I'd completely forgotten about Diaspora. 
- Two, I strongly feel that having -more- options is better than fewer. 
- Finally, I, and the rest of the initial dev-team,  **_REALLY_** just wanted to do a cool project in Rust-lang. 


**Q: Why did you pick Rust-lang?**

Because Rust seemed like a cool system-level(ish) language with built-in security. The fact that it can DO web-stuff is also pretty awesome. 

Go checkout [Are We Web Yet?](http://www.arewewebyet.org/) for more info on the Rusty Web :)
