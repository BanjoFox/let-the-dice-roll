## Real geeks go LARPing

<br />
Just when you thought it was over, Banjo comes back with another long, presumptive rant.  This time it leads to a couple of stories about Live Action Roleplaying (LARPing).  Yes, ACTUAL STORIES!
It does come at the cost of learning a bit about the nerdiest way to play a game though...
