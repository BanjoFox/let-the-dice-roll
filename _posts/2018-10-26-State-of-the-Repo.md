### Back in action
After a painfully long hiatus, I am finally back, and actively poking away at things.  The [chatroom](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#aardwolf-discussion:matrix.org) has sprung to life with some new blood,
as well as some old faces (welcome back KD0BPV).  While it felt shamefully good to let my brain decompress for a while, I kept always thinking how little progress I was making.  This new influx however, 
has really rejuvinated my interest, and I've been busy chattering away, and posting lots of little updates.

### Thank you Redditors
It seems as though some of the new folks have been finding us by way of [This Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/9qle5p/aardwolf_federated_social_network_written_in/)
to which I spent the better part of 4 hours frantically trying to reply to!  So if you are on Reddit, please feel free to spread this around, and ask questions as you see fit :)
I promise I will try to keep up haha :D

### Growing Branches
Here is the real meat of the update.
- i18n-templates, with a great deal of help from Redditor christiansakai is now finally in a semi-working state!!
  This branch includes Baptistes rocket_i18n crate for UI translations, as well as switching from Handlebars.js to Tera.rs templates.
- Master branch still compiles, and has some minor package updates for WebPack.
- Lastly I have added some of my -raw- design_notes to the [aardwolf-interface repository](https://github.com/Aardwolf-Social/aardwolf-interface/tree/master/design_notes) for folks that want to visually see
  how I /think/ things should look.

### Final notes
- Logging is being looked at again
- SMTP functionality is also being re-discussed 
- The "demo" server still is not ready for registrations, but I am thinking about using a different TLD for it.

Cheers!

- Banjo
