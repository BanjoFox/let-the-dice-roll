## Banjo goes rogue

<p>Not one to leave folks hanging, Banjo has done gone off script and recorded an entire episode BY HIMSELF and uncut!!!  Oh the horror, such woe, et. al!!!  We are not at all kidding either... Banjo sits down, with a glass of adult beverage, and just talks into the microphone.  There is a bit of behind-the-scenes stuff, motivations for the podcast, and a whole lot of him ranting.  Will this keep him from ranting endlessly in other episdoes?  Possibly.. fingers crossed!<br />
<br />
Both boys will be back for Season 2 in a little while (next week hopefully!).<br />   
<br />
This episode has been marked "explicit" for some foul language, but really it's just a couple of naughty words that would probably make it a T for Teen rating (the usual).  </p>
