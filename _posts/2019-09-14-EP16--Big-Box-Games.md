<p>Tired of board games that are too small, too "family friendly" or dare we say it... easy to play? &nbsp;Well throw down a big wad of cash on one of these fine titles! &nbsp;All jokes aside, we are talking about board games that are very much in a category of their own. &nbsp;For fans of the genres they represent, they offer a LOT of gaming enjoyment. &nbsp;Both in duration of play, as well as depth of strategy. &nbsp;Some of them even have RPG elements baked right in! &nbsp;No DM required.</p>
