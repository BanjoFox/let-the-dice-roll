<p>Raspathir has gathered together a number of friends to play in a Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign. The setting is called "Curse of Strahd". In this game, Banjo plays a chaotic neutral Tiefling that also happens to be a -very- knowledgeable cleric. This causes problems because the players only see her as a healer... it makes for some interesting roleplaying.</p>
