What started out as a nice conversation about Scion: Hero, a game in which players get to create direct offspring of their favorite gods, turned into a rather anxiety-inducing origin story about a recurring antagonist which Banjo, and his fellow players love to hate.  Mind you there is a bit of ... mild language so this episode has been marked explicit accordingly.
