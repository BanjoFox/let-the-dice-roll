<p>Session Zero is a very important aspect of every roleplaying game. Whether it be for a one-shot, or a multi-year campaign. It is a time where the game host, and players can get to know one another, what they want to play, and even get a bit of a preview for what is to come. While it may not always be necessary, it can certainly clear up a whole bunch of questions.</p>
