<h3><em>Aardwolf powers social, connected communities with open software.</em></h3>

<p>Aardwolf is a new platform for creating new social networks, connected across the web. While existing social media sites work to funnel the world into a single shared experience (and advertising marketplace), we recognize that we are all individuals with different identities and interests.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Aardwolf is the engine behind a new Facebook-like social platform, <a href="http://wearesocial.space">wearesocial.space</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Aardwolf shares a philosophy and underlying protocols with <a href="http://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a>, a federated microblogging platform with over a 1000 independently-run servers, hosting more than a million active users.</p>

<h3>What's Different About Aardwolf?</h3>

<p>Aardwolf is a social platform, meaning that each server hosts it's own community of users who are posting, sharing pictures, links, etc. They are replying and &quot;liking&quot; each other's posts, and re-sharing the ones they like best.</p>

<p>Even better, Aardwolf is a <em>connected</em> (the technical term is &quot;federated&quot;) platform:  users are not  limited to only interacting with other users on their service: they can follow users on other sites that are powered by Aardwolf just as if they were on their own site. They can even connect with users on other platforms, if -- like the microblogging service <a href="http://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a> -- they implement the same open protocols Aardwolf is built on.</p>

<p>Finally, Aardwolf is <a href="https://github.com/banjofox/aardwolf">open source</a>, so developers who want to contribute or understand how it works can dig in and do so.</p>

<h3>Project Status</h3>

<p>The scaffolding is still being built, but the pieces are coming together much quicker than originally anticipated! A sample of the web interface should be online soon.<br />
If you would like to follow along Aardwolf development happens on <a href="https://github.com/banjofox/aardwolf/">Github</a>. Feel free to fork the repo and contribute.</p>
