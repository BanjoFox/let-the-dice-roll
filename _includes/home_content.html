<h3><em>Social gaming is more fun when you Let the Dice Roll</em></h3>

<p>Let the Dice Roll is a podcast that focuses heavily on the more social aspects of gaming.  Each week hosts, Rapathir the blue dragon, and Banjo "So-called" Fox try to tell a story or two about gaming sessions past.  Where others might provide tips for how to improve, the lessons almost always end with what not to do in a given situation.  Most of the time, they try to provide some background about the game, but occasionally there are much longer forays into other areas of the roleplaying hobby.  Thankfully they always return to the foibles, botches, and good old-fashioned fun of sharing a few tales of what happens when you Let the Dice Roll.</p>
